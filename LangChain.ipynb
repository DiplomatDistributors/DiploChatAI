    "\n",
    "        - STORNEXT datasets (`stnx_sales`, `stnx_items`) represent **Sell-Out** data — consumer-level sales aggregated at the retail format level.  \n",

    "        - Use `inv_df` to analyze Diplomat's sell-in performance to customers.  \n",
    "        - Use `stnx_sales` to analyze market-level sell-out trends by retail format.  \n",
    "        - Use `chp` to analyze item-level pricing, promotions, and store-level dynamics.  \n",
    "        - For cross-dataset comparison, always bridge `inv_df` to `stnx_sales` or `chp` through `material_df`, which maps internal product codes (`MATERIAL_NUMBER`) to consumer-facing barcodes (`BARCODE_EA`).\n",

    "                4. Use the `stnx_sales` dataset to sum the total sales (`Sales_NIS`) of:\n",

    "                    - The entire category.\n",

    "                6. If category sales are zero, return market share as 0% to avoid division by zero.                 \n",
